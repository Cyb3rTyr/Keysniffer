># KeySniffer

>## Explanation
>This is a Python script named Keysniffer. It is a classic keylogger designed to record keystrokes from the keyboard and filter them to identify valuable information. (This project is developed for educational purposes as part of a school assignment.)
>
>The identified valuable information includes ***phone numbers***, ***email addresses***, ***URLs***, ***credit card details***, ***dates*** and ***IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)***.

> ## How to use it 
> First change the email information, open the Keysniffer.py and go down to the email sending part. You will find a clear part in where to change the information. Enter the email of the sender and the email of the receiver. Keep in mind that the email of the sender needs to have the password (IT IS NOT THE PASSOWRD FROM THE EMAIL)

>### How to make the "sender email"
>1. Create a normal email, like you would do for yourself.
>2. Go to the ***google account*** (of the new email created)
>3. Search in the search bar for ***App Passwords***
>4. Create a new one and name it ***Python***, after that a password will show up. (If it doesnt show up retry creating a new one)
>5. Copy it and paste it in the ***keysniffer.py*** as the password for the email, remove spaces.
